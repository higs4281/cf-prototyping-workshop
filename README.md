# Prototyping in the browser with Capital Framework

## Introduction

This repository goes along with a workshop given at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau January 26, 2016. It’s meant for designer types who are comfortable enough with front-end web stuff (HTML, CSS, Javascript) to copy and paste examples and to write some basic custom code.

Even if you weren’t at the workshop, you should still be able to follow along on your own just by reading this readme. If you have any questions, get in touch with me via my GitHub profile and I’ll do my best to help.

## Why prototype in the browser?

Here at the beginning of 2016, there are dozens of tools you can use to create interactive prototypes of websites or apps. Each has its own pros and cons. Low fidelity sketches are quick and cheap, but they're terrible at conveying real interactions. Prototyping tools like Axure lower the bar for making interactive prototypes you can test in a browser, but all they’re really doing is putting a novice user interface on making a web page (and no interface I’ve ever seen gets responsive prototypes right). Cajoling a front-end developer to make your prototype for you gets you a really high fidelity prototype, but it’s too costly to use to test quick ideas.

I think prototyping in the browser using simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript hits a sweet spot right in the middle of all those methods. With a little practice, you’ll get comfortable enough to churn out high fidelity, testable prototypes quickly and cheaply. With a little more practice, you’ll be making custom designs that fit your product’s needs way better than even the best prototyping tool could. Even better, if you use a good framework (like, say, Capital Framework) to prototype, responsiveness and accessibility will be baked right in.

This workshop will walk you through the steps to create, share, and review simple prototypes using nothing more than a good text editor and your favorite web browser (OK, OK, and a few command line tools like git and gulp, too). But first, a few general tips to keep in mind when starting to prototype in the browser.

## General tips

**Start simple.**

Sometimes I start the page just by writing out what needs to happen on the page. Design up from there, ideally testing lots along the way to figure out when you've designed enough.

**Copy and recycle.**

Design with a framework.

Use as much past work as you can (especially if it's been validating with tests).

**Don’t think like a developer (even if you’re a developer).**

The point of prototyping isn't to write production-quality code, it's to quickly test (and discard!) ideas. Don't worry about doing everything perfectly.

## Actually making a thing instead of reading about actually making a thing

### Install and clone

Node, npm, gulp (and git)

Fork repo

Clone repo

### Choose a template

### Add some elements

### Enhance as needed

Fill in additional elements and interactions as needed (GitHub is a good place to look)

Web inspector

scrollTo

Sticky scroll

### Share

Publish (GitHub pages)

### Review and test

Getting feedback can be hard (PDF, screenshots, etc.)

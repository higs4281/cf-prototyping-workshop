  definition: |
    Downloads the dependencies listed in `bower.json` and optionally routes
    dependency assets to specified folders if those assets are categorized by
    `exportsOverride`.
  body: |
    If a dependeny you've listed contains its own `bower.json` file that uses the
    `main` property then `bower-install` will download your dependency and remove
    everything from its folder except for the `main` file.
    This is helpful because most Bower packages are simply GitHub repositories that
    contain a lot of extraneous files that we don't actually need.

    If no `main` property is listed but you've added this dependency to
    `exportsOverride` then only the files listed there will be saved.
    Note however that those assets might get moved around depending on how you
    categorize them.
  examples: |
    Assuming that you have listed the following two dependencies...

    {% highlight js %}
    "dependencies": {
      "cf-colors": "git://github.com/cfpb/cf-colors.git",
      "font-awesome": "~3.2.1"
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

    The output would be...

    {% highlight bash %}
    src/
    └ vendor/
      ├ cf-colors/
      │ └ cf-colors.less
      └ font-awesome/
    {% endhighlight %}

    When you list a dependency it might also have dependencies of its own.
    For example, `cf-buttons` lists `cf-colors`, `cf-typography`, and `font-awesome`
    as dependencies. If you added `cf-buttons` to your project you would end up with:

    {% highlight bash %}
    src
    └ vendor
      ├ cf-buttons
      ├ cf-colors
      ├ cf-typography
      └ font-awesome
    {% endhighlight %}
